Hey there. Glad you found this :)
This was my first project in College. It is not anything too fancy
It is an apartment management system that is created using PHP, HTML and some little JavaScript
MySqL was used for the Database management and good thing...it works
Feel free to make any improvements to it ðŸ’¯
